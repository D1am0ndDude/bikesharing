This first graph shares the user to the data story with explaining that this story covers NYC Citi Bike Data. The front page is a dashboard showing three important high level pieces of data: Average Trip Duration, Rides by Gender, and Starting Locations. This data will inform the potential investors what the trip duration (in seconds) is depending on the age of the customer, help them understand who the customer is by gender, and where the supply of bikes should go in NYC.

This graph shows investors the number of trips according to the total trip duration. Most trips are less than 1 hour. This means one bike can be used by a large amount of customers in one day.

# Checkout time by Gender

The graph shows potential investors the number of trips according to the total trip duration by gender. We can see that short trips are not really effected by Gender.

This shows investors the number of trips depending on the hour and day of the week according to gender. The data shows that the trend of commuting and weekend demand identified above does not change too much depending of the gender of the customer.

This graph shows investors the number of trips depending on the day of the week by different types of customers according to Gender. We can see that Male subscribers is high, and we can use that data to target them to become subscribers to drive recenue.

# August Peak Hours

The Bar Graph shows the demand of bike rides during the day. The peak is between 5pm - 7pm. The Lowest demand is 2am - 5pm. Meaning that is the best time to repair the bikes when needed.

# Bike Utilization

This bubble graph shows the number of trips per Bike ID. The data shows that while there are a few bikes that are used very oftern and will need more maintanance, most bikes aren't used as frequently and will need fewer costly repairs.

## Summary
The Bike Share Story provides a lot of useful information that investors can easily understand. We are able to see the Demand, Maintanance, and Customer Base. Two suggested visualizations would be to add Bike rides during the Holidays, and During the harsh winter months.
