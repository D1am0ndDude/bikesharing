This first graph shares the user to the data story with explaining that this story covers NYC Citi Bike Data. The front page is a dashboard showing three important high level pieces of data: Average Trip Duration, Rides by Gender, and Starting Locations. This data will inform the potential investors what the trip duration (in seconds) is depending on the age of the customer, help them understand who the customer is by gender, and where the supply of bikes should go in NYC.
